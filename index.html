          <h1>Huginn and Muninn welcome you!</h1>
          <p>
            In Norse mythology, Huginn (Old Norse: "thought") and Muninn (Old
            Norse "memory" or "mind") are a pair of ravens that fly all over the
            world, Midgard, and bring information to the god Odin. The ravens
            tell Odin everything they see and hear. Odin sends Huginn and Muninn
            out at dawn, and the birds fly all over the world before returning
            at dinner-time. As a result, Odin is kept informed of many events.

              Viking warriors are associated with horned helmets in popular
              culture, but there is no evidence that Viking helmets had horns.

            <p>
              A Viking's primary defensive weapon was the shield. Because it was
              round, it was called <i>r√∂nd</i>.

              Longships were naval vessels made and used by the Vikings from
              Scandinavia and Iceland for trade, commerce, exploration, and
              warfare during the Viking Age.
