              In Norse mythology, Huginn (Old Norse: "thought") and Muninn (Old
              Norse "memory" or "mind") are a pair of ravens that fly all over
              the world, Midgard, and bring information to the god Odin. The
              ravens tell Odin everything they see and hear. Odin sends Huginn
              and Muninn out at dawn, and the birds fly all over the world
              before returning at dinner-time. As a result, Odin is kept
              informed of many events.

            Viking warriors are associated with horned helmets in popular
            culture, but there is no evidence that Viking helmets had horns. The
            depiction of these horned helmets as historical is a fallacy that
            began in the 1870s. It was part of the construction of great Norse
            myths to be adopted by Germans, who wanted their own ancestral
            myths.

            A Viking's primary defensive weapon was the shield. Because it was
            round, it was called <i>r√∂nd</i>. Shields were about a yard across.
            Only the buckle and the rim was made of iron. The rest was made of
            light wood such as pine, spruce, maple or yew. Rawhide covered the
            surface and the shield had bright colors: yellow and black or red
            and black. The color could also send a message. Red shields signaled
            war. A white shield meant peace.

            Longships were naval vessels made and used by the Vikings from
            Scandinavia and Iceland for trade, commerce, exploration, and
            warfare during the Viking Age. Longships were naval vessels made and

            A stave church is a medieval wooden Christian church building once
            common in north-western Europe. The name derives from the building's
            structure of post and lintel construction, a type of timber framing
            where the load-bearing ore-pine posts are called <i>stafr</i> in Old
            Norse (<i>stav</i> in modern Norwegian).
